    <h3>God of War is an action-adventure game franchise created by David Jaffe at Sony's Santa Monica Studio. It began
        in 2005 on the PlayStation 2 (PS2) video game console and has become a flagship series for PlayStation,
        consisting of nine installments across multiple platforms. Based on ancient mythologies, the story follows
        Kratos, a Spartan warrior and later the Greek God of War, who was tricked into killing his family by his former
        master, the original Greek God of War Ares. This sets off a series of events that leads to wars with the
        different mythological pantheons. The Greek-based games see Kratos follow a path of vengeance due to the
        machinations of the Olympian gods, while the Norse-based games, which introduced his son Atreus as a secondary
        protagonist, show an older Kratos on a path of redemption and inadvertently coming into conflict with the Norse
        gods.</h3>
