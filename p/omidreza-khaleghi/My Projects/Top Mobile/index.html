These panels are protected by Kunlun glass and use a built-in fingerprint sensor.Huawei phones are deprived of Google mobile services, therefore they are not welcomed by users in international markets.Huawei phones are deprived of Google mobile services, therefore they are not welcomed by users in international markets.</p>

            <p class="mobile-de">Google's pixels are known to focus on the camera, and especially the software capabilities. The imaging experience provided a high level. Some experts consider the imaging performance to be better than the flagship iPhones and flagships. Unlike the previous generation, it is said to be available with a 4 Hz screen to make animations more smoother. This phone will probably have a dual camera again. Google is unlikely to equip the Pixel 7A with three cameras. The pixels have a dedicated chip and most likely the Pixel 7A will use the Tensor G2 chip.</p>
